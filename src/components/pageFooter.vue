						<h5>5. How we share personal data</h5>
						<p>5.1 We will share supporters’ personal data with Mary’s Meals International Organisation (company registration number SC488380 and charity number SC045223), which has its registered office at Craig Lodge, Dalmally, Argyll PA33 1AR (“MMI”) in their role as the provider of the Mary’s Meals supporter database platform. MMI will only access personal records of supporters if requested to do so by us, to assist us in the delivery of our services.  Beyond this, we will only share supporters’ personal data if:</p>
						<p>(a) we or MMI are working with partners whom we or MMI have carefully selected to carry out work on our behalf, such as service providers and sub-contractors (for example, IT services providers and providers of technical, payment and delivery services) to perform any contract we or MMI enter into with them.  The kind of work we or MMI may ask them to do includes processing, packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering questions about us and any services we provide, carrying out research or analysis to assist us in our mission and processing credit card payments.</p>
						<p>We and MMI only choose partners we trust and only pass personal data to them where they have undertaken to keep your personal data secure.  We do not allow, and we ensure that MMI does not allow, these partners to use your data for their own purposes or disclose it to other third parties and we will take all reasonable care to ensure that such partners keep your data secure; or </p>

						<p>(b) we are legally required to do so e.g. by law or by an order of a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
						<p>We will not sell supporters’ information. We will not share supporters’ information with other organisations other than as stated above.</p>

						<h5>6. Legal basis for processing personal data</h5>
						<p>We rely on various legal bases to justify our processing of supporters’ personal data.  Further details of these are set out below.<p>
						<p>(a) The supporters have given their consent to the processing of their personal data for the specific purposes mentioned above. </p>
						<p>The supporters may withdraw their consent to this processing at any time by contacting us using the contact details set out in the “Contact and Complaints” section of this Privacy Policy below, but this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing of their personal data which was carried out before they withdrew their consent.</p>
						<p>(b) The processing is necessary for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include processing, packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering questions about us and any services we provide, carrying out research or analysis to assist us in our mission and processing credit card payments.</p>
						<p>(c) The processing is necessary to perform a contract to which the relevant supporters are parties or to take steps that they have asked us to take before entering into a contract, such as buying a book or a DVD or requesting a free film screening pack about our work.</p>
						<p>(d) The processing is necessary for us, as the data controller, to comply with our legal obligations, such as sharing personal data where we are legally required to do so e.g. by law or by an order of a court.</p>

 						<h5>7. Where we transfer and store personal data</h5>
						<p>7.1 The personal data that we collect from supporters may be transferred to and/or stored at destinations outside the UK, but within the European Economic Area, (the “EEA”). As such, adequate protection for such personal and sensitive personal data will be ensured. However, it may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for one of our or MMI’s suppliers (e.g. IT service providers) – in these instances, we carefully select suppliers or will ensure that MMI selects suppliers with whom we or MMI have appropriate contractual arrangements in place to ensure safeguarding of our supporters’ personal data. This includes staff involved in, among other things, providing support services and processing payment details.  We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that supporters’ personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
						<p>7.2 All information that supporters provide to us is stored on our secure servers and/or on the servers of our suppliers who we have engaged to host various IT systems for us. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using TLS technology.  Where we have given supporters (or where they have chosen) a password which enables them to access certain parts of our website, they are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask them not to share this password with anyone.</p>
						<p>7.3 Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect supporters’ personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to our website; any transmission is at supporters’ own risk. Once we have received personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
						<p>7.4 Our mission is to enable people to offer their money, goods, skills, time, or prayer, and through this involvement, provide the most effective help to those suffering the effects of extreme poverty in the world’s poorest communities. We will keep supporters’ information only for as long as they engage with us in any of the above ways, and only as long as we need it:</p>
						<p>(a) to administer their relationship with us;</p>
						<p>(b) to comply with the law; or</p>
						<p>(c) to ensure we do not communicate with supporters who have asked us not to.</p>

						<p>To assist us in this process we will review on a regular basis the personal data of supporters that we collect and hold to ensure that such data is only kept for an appropriate length of time.</p>
						
						<h5>8. Individuals’ rights</h5>
						<p>8.1 Supporters have certain rights in respect of the personal data that we hold about them. To exercise any of the rights set out below, please contact us using the contact details set out in the “Contact and complaints” section of this Privacy Policy below: </p>
						<p>(a) Access. We will confirm to supporters whether or not we are processing and using personal data about them, at their request and, if so, provide them with access to and a copy of such personal data and the other details to which they are entitled.  </p>
						<p>(b) Rectification. We will correct any inaccurate personal data and complete any incomplete personal data (including by providing a supplementary statement) that we hold about supporters without undue delay at their request.</p>
						<p>(c) Prevention of processing likely to cause damage or distress. We will respect our supporters’ rights to require us to cease or not to begin processing their personal data for a specific purpose, or in a specific way, that is likely to cause unwarranted damage or distress, either to the relevant individual or a third party.</p>
						<p>(d) Erasure. We will erase personal data concerning a supporter at their request without undue delay in certain circumstances, (for example, among other things, if their personal data is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise used). </p>
						<p>(e) Restriction. We will restrict the processing of supporters’ personal data in certain circumstances (for example, among other things, if they believe that their personal data held by us is inaccurate), if requested by them to do so. </p>
						<p>(f) Data portability. We will respect the rights of supporters to receive personal data about them that they have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit such personal data to another data controller without hindrance from us in certain circumstances. </p>
						<p>(g) Right to object. We will respect the general rights of supporters to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances. </p>
						<p>(h) Right to object to marketing. We will respect supporters’ rights regarding use of their personal data for direct marketing purposes. In particular, we will not begin or we will cease processing any personal data of individuals for direct marketing purposes if at any time individuals ask us not to do so. </p>
						<p>(i) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Where requested, we will not make decisions based on automated processing, including profiling and we will ensure that you can always obtain a review by one of our staff members of any automated decisions and are able to express your point of view and contest any such decisions.</p>
						<p>We will not make any automated decisions based on sensitive personal information unless we have obtained your explicit consent to do so, or this is otherwise necessary for substantial public interest reasons based on applicable law.</p>

						<p>8.2 We will process all personal data in line with supporters’ rights in each case to the extent required by and in accordance with applicable law only (including, without limitation, in accordance with any applicable time limits and requirements regarding fees and charges). </p>

						<p>8.3 We will respect supporters’ rights regarding use of their personal data for direct marketing purposes.  In particular, we will not begin or we will cease processing any personal data of individuals for direct marketing purposes if at any time a supporter asks us to stop. </p>

						<p>8.4 Supporters can exercise their rights by contacting us using the contact details set out below in the “Contacts and complaints” section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
